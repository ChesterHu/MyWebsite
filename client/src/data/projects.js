# Selected Projects

## Automated Media Platform
In the summer of 2018, I worked as a software engineer intern in Microsoft STCA, where I involved in the development of a [media application](https://music.163.com/#/djradio?id=349365818). My project is to build a processor that can convert text to wav voice. I also integrated open source NLP models into my project in order to correct typos and pronunciation errors. The processor now can provide fully managed, I/O efficient media generation. The data processing speed of the processor is around 5ms/word. In this project, I aquired hands-on experience of industry projects and learned algorithms and [data structures](https://github.com/ChesterHu/DataStructure) to build more efficient program.

## Human Face Detection by Boosting Techniques
I implemented the algorithm during my graduate study. The object of this project is detecting human face by AdaBoost and RealBoost. The training set contains 11838 human face images and 45356 non face images. The images were first converted to integral image in order to reduce the time complexity of computing the predictions from hundreds of filters. The project is written in C++ and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ChesterHu/Human-face-detection-by-Boosting-techniques/tree/master).

## Movie Database Application
Developed a database driven IMDB-like website. Right now, the website has input, browse and search pages that allow users to add, retrieve and search data by HTML forms. This [project is originally written in php](https://github.com/ChesterHu/Movie-Rating-Webpage) and I plan to integrate React into it and deploy it before the end of 2019.
